<Note>
  This is a general overview of fine-tuning and what it is. If you want to learn how to fine-tune a model, please refer to the [Fine-Tuning Guide](/finetuning/get-started).
</Note>

**_Prem Studio_** offers fine-tuning capabilities so you can create a custom model without needing to be a machine learning expert.

Fine-tuning an AI model serves several important purposes:

- Adaptation to specific tasks: Fine-tuning allows a pre-trained model to specialize in particular domains or tasks that may differ from its original training data.
- Improved performance: It typically enhances accuracy and relevance for specific use cases compared to using a generic model.
- Efficiency: Fine-tuning requires significantly less data and computational resources than training a model from scratch.
- Customization: Organizations can tailor models to their unique requirements, terminology, or style.
- Overcoming limitations: It can help address biases or gaps in the original model's knowledge for particular applications.
- Rapid development: Fine-tuning accelerates the deployment of AI solutions by building on existing model capabilities.

# How it works

1. Create a [Snapshot](/datasets/create-snapshot) of your [dataset](/datasets/overview).
2. [Fine-tune](/finetuning/get-started) your model on your [dataset](/datasets/overview).
3. [Evaluate](/evaluations/get-started) your model.
