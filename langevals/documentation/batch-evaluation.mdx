When exploring, it is common to generate multiple outputs from your LLM and then evaluate their performance scores, for example, using a Jupyter Notebook. 
LangEvals provides the `evaluate()` function to score these results in batch using diverse evaluators. 
This section will guide you through batch evaluation with multiple evaluators and demonstrate how to conveniently access the results.

### Importing the Library 
First, import `langevals` along with the evaluators that you will use.
```python
import langevals
from langevals_ragas.answer_relevancy import RagasAnswerRelevancyEvaluator
from langevals_langevals.competitor_blocklist import (
    CompetitorBlocklistEvaluator,
    CompetitorBlocklistSettings,
)
```

### Creating Evaluation Dataset 
Next, create a pandas DataFrame with `input` and `output` columns. 
Each column represents the input and output of the LLM. 
It is important to name these columns exactly as shown to ensure compatibility with the evaluators. 
Some evaluators may require additional fields such as `contexts` and `expected_output`.
```python
import pandas as pd

entries = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "input": ["hello", "how are you?", "what is your name?"],
        "output": ["hi", "I am a chatbot, no feelings", "My name is Bob"],
    }
)
```

### Run Evaluations
With a single call to the evaluate method, you can evaluate all data entries using the specified evaluators. 
Note that certain evaluators require a settings parameter.
In this case, it is used to define the competitor's name to be blocklisted. 
For further documentation, refer to [Evaluators](href="/documentation/evaluators"). 
```python
results = langevals.evaluate(
    entries,
    [
        RagasAnswerRelevancyEvaluator(),
        CompetitorBlocklistEvaluator(
            settings=CompetitorBlocklistSettings(competitors=["Bob"])
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Access the Results
Finally, the results can be accessed as a pandas dataframe. 
```python
results.to_pandas()
```

Results:

| input              | output                      | answer_relevancy | competitor_blocklist | competitor_blocklist_details |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| hello              | hi                          | 0.800714         | True                 | None                         |
| how are you?       | I am a chatbot, no feelings | 0.813168         | True                 | None                         |
| what is your name? | My name is Bob              | 0.971663         | False                | Competitors mentioned: Bob   |
