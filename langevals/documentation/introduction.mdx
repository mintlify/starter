[LangEvals](https://github.com/langwatch/langevals) is the standalone LLM evaluations framework that powers LangWatch evaluations.

LangEvals integrates many APIs and other open-source evaluators under the same interface, to be used locally as a library.

It can be used in notebooks for **exploration**, in pytest for writting **unit tests** or as a server API for **live-evaluations** and **guardrails**.
LangEvals is modular, including 20+ evaluators such as Ragas for RAG quality, OpenAI Moderation and Azure Jailbreak detection for safety and many others under the same interface.
