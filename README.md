- Guide pages
- Navigation

### Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```bash
mintlify dev
```

### Publishing Changes

Install our Github App to auto propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch. Find the link to install on your dashboard.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
- RequestError with code ETIMEDOUT – This indicates a network error. Please check your internet connection. You may also want to review your firewall settings, try using a VPN, or switch to a DNS service like Cloudflare or Google DNS.
