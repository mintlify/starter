title: Troubleshooting and Support
---

While using LangWatch, you may encounter issues or have questions that need further assistance. This page outlines the steps you can take to troubleshoot problems and how to reach out for support when you need it.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Before reaching out for support, here are a few steps you can take to resolve common issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that your `LANGWATCH_API_KEY` is correctly set in your environment. This is a common issue that can prevent LangWatch from functioning properly.

2. **Review Integration Code**: Go through your integration code to ensure that you've followed the steps outlined in the [Getting Started](#) documentation. Sometimes, issues arise from a missed step or incorrect implementation.

3. **Consult the Documentation**: Look through the documentation for sections relevant to the issue you're facing. There might be specific notes or sections that address your problem.

4. **Update LangWatch**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the `langwatch` library. Outdated versions may contain bugs that have been resolved in newer releases.

   You can update the library using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade langwatch
   ```

5. **Examine Error Messages**: If there are error messages being returned from LangWatch or your LLM provider, inspect them closely as they often provide clues to the root cause.
