To promote data decentralization, TRUF's ecosystem pools are managed and led by governance token holders. This empowerment allows token holders to oversee ecosystem pools, guiding resource allocation and strategic direction based on community consensus, thereby enhancing transparency, fairness, and resilience within the ecosystem.
