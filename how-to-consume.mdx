description: "Learn how to interact with the TRUF Network using SDKs and API endpoints."
---

The TRUF Network provides multiple ways to consume its data. Developers can integrate with the network using SDKs, direct API calls, or predefined API endpoints. Here's how to get started:

## 1. SDKs

The TRUF Network offers SDKs for various programming languages, simplifying integration with its services.

- **Installation**:
  To get started, install the SDK for your language. For example, in Go:
```bash
  go get github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-go
```

- **Usage**:
Use the SDK to interact with the network. Example in Go:
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/golang-sql/civil"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/crypto/auth"
	"github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-go/core/tsnclient"
	"github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-go/core/types"
	"github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-sdk-go/core/util"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create TSN client
	pk, _ := crypto.Secp256k1PrivateKeyFromHex("<your-private-key-hex>")
	signer := &auth.EthPersonalSigner{Key: *pk}
	tsnClient, err := tsnclient.NewClient(ctx, "<https://tsn-provider-url.com>", tsnclient.WithSigner(signer))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Load an existing stream
	streamId := util.GenerateStreamId("your-stream-name")
	// if we intend to use streams from another provider, we create locators using the provider's address
	streamLocator := tsnClient.OwnStreamLocator(streamId)
	stream, err := tsnClient.LoadPrimitiveStream(streamLocator)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Read data from the stream
	dateFrom, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-01")
	dateTo, _ := civil.ParseDate("2023-01-31")
	records, err := stream.GetRecord(ctx, types.GetRecordInput{
		DateFrom: &dateFrom,
		DateTo:   &dateTo,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, record := range records {
		fmt.Println(record.DateValue, record.Value.String())
	}
}
```

## 2. API Endpoints

The API Endpoints are currently under rapid development. Stay tuned for updates and refer to this section as new endpoints are introduced.

## 3. API Calls

The ability to make direct API calls will be available soon. Stay tuned for detailed documentation, including example requests and responses.
