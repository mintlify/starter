title: Generate Dataset from Text Files (PDF, DOCX, and more)
description: Learn how to transform raw text documents into structured question-answering datasets using Prem Studio for fine-tuning and evaluation.

## üß† Why This Matters

Creating high-quality QA datasets is often a bottleneck. With synthetic QA generation, you can:
- Convert any text source into structured QA pairs.
- Quickly scale your dataset with minimal manual effort.
- Prepare reliable data for fine-tuning or evaluating small and large language models (SLMs/LLMs).

**Example use case - Structured Output from Receipts**
In this guide we will see how to synthetically generate QA pairs from a set of receipts.
We‚Äôll use **20 invoice receipts** from [this dataset](https://github.com/JensWalter/my-receipts). Each file will generate **1 Synthetic QA pair**, producing a structured JSON output that extracts key fields (date, total amount, business name, etc.).

This type of dataset is crucial for fine-tuning models that need to **reliably extract structured data** from semi-structured sources (like receipts, tickets, or invoices).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Using QA Generation in Prem Studio

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a New Dataset">
        <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/nav-to-sd.gif" alt="GIF of navigating to synthetic data" />
        From the left sidebar, go to **Datasets** ‚Üí **+ Create dataset** ‚Üí **Synthetic Data**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upload Your Input Files">
        <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/upload-files.gif" alt="GIF of uploading input files" />
        Drag and drop your text files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML).
        üìå In this example, we use 20 invoice receipts.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Advanced Settings (Optional but Recommended)">
        <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/datasets/advanced-settings.png" alt="Advanced Settings" />
        This step lets you **steer the QA generation** toward your expected output. It includes:

        - **Rules & Constraints** ‚Üí enforce requirements.
        - **QA Examples (up to 3)** ‚Üí provide few-shot examples to guide generation.
        - **Question/Answer Guidance** ‚Üí define QA formats.
        - **Creativity Level** ‚Üí adjust diversity of generated QAs.

        For our receipts example:

        **Rules & Constraints**:
        ```text
        - Always include the full extracted text in the question.
        - Clearly instruct extraction into the given JSON schema.
        - Only output the JSON object (no extra text).
        - Fill fields only if explicitly present in the text.
        - If a field is missing, leave it empty but keep the key.
        - Strictly follow the schema.
        - Never infer, guess, or fabricate information.
        ```

        **Question Format**
        ```text
        {EXTRACTED_TEXT}
        Task: Extract all the information available in the text and present it in the JSON format below.
        Do not infer or invent details ‚Äî only include what is explicitly stated.
        JSON Schema:
        {
            "DateTime": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
            "Total Amount": "number",
            "Currency": "string",
            "Business Name": "string",
            "Business Location": "string"
        }
        ```

        **Answer Format**
        ```json
        {
            "DateTime": "<transaction_datetime_if_present>",
            "Total Amount": "<total_amount_if_present>",
            "Currency": "<currency_code_if_present>",
            "Business Name": "<business_name_if_present>",
            "Business Location": "<city_state_country_if_present>"
        }
        ```

        **Creativity**: set to 0
    </Step>

    <Step title="4. Review & Generate">
        Before starting, you‚Äôll see a **recap** of your setup:
        - Data sources (your input files).
        - Generation settings (QA per file, creativity level, etc.).
        - Estimated cost.
        Click Create dataset to start the process.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Review Your Synthetic Dataset">
    Once generated, preview your QAs directly in Prem Studio.
    From the UI, you can also **edit or delete datapoints** to refine the dataset before using it.
    </Step>


</Steps>


## üì¶ What‚Äôs Next?

You can now:
- Preview and edit the generated data
- Fine-tune your model with it (see our [fine-tuning guide](../../finetuning/get-started))
- Evaluate models against it (see our [evaluation guide](../../evaluations/get-started))


## üí° Pro Tips
-  Always define advanced settings if you expect strict outputs.
- Start small (10‚Äì20 docs) to validate your setup, then scale up.
- Use domain-specific schemas (invoices, medical records, support tickets, etc.).
- Keep creativity low when extracting structured data.
