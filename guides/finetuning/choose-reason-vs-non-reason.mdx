title: Choose Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning
description: How to choose between reasoning and non-reasoning fine-tuning to optimize your model's performance.
---

When fine-tuning an LLM in Prem Studio, you'll need to decide between **reasoning** and **non-reasoning** approaches. This choice significantly impacts your model's behavior, training time, and performance on different types of tasks.

## What's the Difference?

**Reasoning Fine-Tuning** teaches models to show their thinking process step-by-step before arriving at an answer. The model learns to break down complex problems, consider multiple perspectives, and explain its reasoning.

**Non-Reasoning Fine-Tuning** focuses on direct input-output mapping. The model learns to provide answers quickly without showing intermediate steps or explanations.

## When to Use Each Approach

| Scenario | Reasoning | Non-Reasoning | Example Use Case |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Complex problem-solving** üßÆ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Mathematical word problems, multi-step analysis |
| **Fast response times needed** ‚ö° | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Chatbots, real-time translation, autocomplete |
| **Transparency required** üîç | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Medical diagnosis support, legal research |
| **Simple classification tasks** üè∑Ô∏è | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Sentiment analysis, content moderation |
| **Educational applications** üìö | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Tutoring systems, homework help |
| **High-volume API calls** üìà | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Content generation, summarization at scale |
| **Debugging model decisions** üîß | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Understanding why a model made specific choices |
| **Creative writing** ‚úçÔ∏è | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Story generation, marketing copy |

## When to Choose Non-Reasoning

<Steps>
    <Step title="Speed-Critical Applications">
    Choose non-reasoning when response time is crucial:

    - **Real-time chat**: Customer support bots, conversational AI
    - **High-throughput processing**: Batch content generation, data labeling
    - **Interactive applications**: Autocomplete, instant search suggestions
    </Step>

    <Step title="Simple, Direct Tasks">
    When the task has a clear input-output relationship:

    - **Classification**: Sentiment analysis, topic categorization
    - **Format conversion**: JSON to text, data transformation
    - **Pattern matching**: Named entity recognition, keyword extraction

    <Note>
        Non-reasoning fine-tuning typically converges faster and requires less computational resources.
    </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Creative or Stylistic Tasks">
    When the process matters less than the final output:

    - Creative writing and content generation
    - Style transfer and tone adjustment
    - Language translation where fluency matters more than showing steps
    </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Choose Reasoning

<Steps>
    <Step title="Complex Multi-Step Tasks">
    Choose reasoning when your task requires breaking down problems into smaller steps:

    - **Mathematical problems**: "Solve this equation step by step"
    - **Analysis tasks**: "Analyze this business case and recommend actions"
    - **Research questions**: "Compare these theories and explain the differences"

    <Note>
        Reasoning fine-tuning typically takes longer but produces more explainable and trustworthy outputs for complex tasks.
    </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="High-Stakes Decisions">
    When accuracy and explainability matter more than speed:

    - Medical or legal applications where decisions need justification
    - Financial analysis where reasoning must be auditable
    - Educational tools where learning the process is important

    <Warning>
        Use reasoning fine-tuning only when you can provide high-quality training data with step-by-step explanations.
    </Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Debugging and Interpretability">
    When you need to understand why a model made specific decisions:

    - Model behavior analysis
    - Identifying bias or errors in reasoning
    - Building trust with end users who need to understand outputs
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Hybrid Approach: When You're Unsure

If you're uncertain which approach to use, consider these strategies:

1. **Start with Non-Reasoning** for faster iteration and baseline performance
2. **Test with Reasoning** if initial results lack the depth or accuracy you need
3. **Use both approaches** for different parts of your application (reasoning for complex queries, non-reasoning for simple ones)

## Implementation in Prem Studio

<Steps>
    <Step title="Select Your Fine-Tuning Type">
    When creating a fine-tuning job in Prem Studio:

    - Choose **"Reasoning"** for tasks requiring step-by-step thinking
    - Choose **"Non-Reasoning"** for direct input-output mapping

    </Step>

    <Step title="After this it's all the same">
    **For Reasoning**: You have only two models to choose from. Those are:
    - Qwen 2.5 7B reasoning
    - Qwen 2.5 3B reasoning

    <img src="/images/guides/reasoning_models.png" alt="Reasoning Models" style={{maxWidth: '100%', margin: '16px 0'}} />

    **For Non-Reasoning**: You have a lot of models to choose from, ranging from Qwen, Gemma, Llama, Phi models.

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Output from reasoning vs non-reasoning models

The output from reasoning models is a bit different from the output from non-reasoning models.
In reasoning models, it will first show it's thought process under `<think> </think>` tag, and
then it will show the final answer under `<answer> </answer>` tag. Here is an example:
