# 🧠 Why This Matters

Don’t have a ready-made QA dataset? You don’t need one anymore.

Whether you’re fine-tuning a model or building a knowledge assistant, having QA data is essential. But not everyone has the time or resources to create it from scratch.

This feature lets you:
	•	✅ Convert any textual content into usable QA pairs.
	•	🚀 Instantly scale your training data, even from a few documents.
	•	🔄 Reuse your documentation, whitepapers, or reports to fuel model training.
	•	🛠️ Prepare data for model fine-tuning — natively supported in Prem Studio.


## 📁 What You’ll Need

To get started, you only need:
	•	A set of text-based input files (e.g. .pdf, .txt, .docx, .html)
	•	A Prem Studio account
	•	Optionally: Custom instructions to guide the QA generation process

In this example, we’ll use 5 input files about crypto concepts and trends.


# ⚙️ Step-by-Step: Using QA Generation in Prem Studio

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Dataset from the Datasets Section">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/nav-to-sd.gif" alt="GIF of navigating to synthetic data" />


    From the left sidebar, click on **Datasets**, then **+ Create dataset** (top right), and select the option **Synthetic Data**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upload Your Input Files">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/upload-files.gif" alt="GIF of uploading input files" />

    Drag and drop your documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT, HTML). In our example, we use 5 crypto-related files.

    <Step title="(Optional) Add Custom Instructions">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/custom-instructions.gif" alt="GIF of entering instructions" />

    Tailor the output with extra instructions, e.g.:

    ```
    Only create questions related to blockchain, DeFi, and crypto tokens. Avoid generic or repetitive questions. Keep answers short and factual.
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate Your Dataset">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/click-generate.gif" alt="GIF of generating dataset" />

    Click **Generate Dataset** and let Prem Studio do the rest. In our example, we generate 100 QA pairs from 5 documents in under a minute.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Review Your Synthetic Dataset">
    <img src="https://static.premai.io/prem-saas-docs/guides/review-dataset.gif" alt="GIF of reviewing and editing the datapoints" />

    Click **Generate Dataset** and let Prem Studio do the rest. In our example, we generate 100 QA pairs from 5 documents in under a minute.

    </Step>

</Steps>


Once the process is complete, you’ll be able to preview the generated dataset, edit any entries, and use it directly in Prem Studio’s fine-tuning and evaluation tools.


Example Output

Question	Answer
What is a blockchain?	A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions.
What is the main purpose of tokens in DeFi?	To facilitate decentralized financial operations.
How do smart contracts work?	They execute predefined actions automatically based on conditions.



# 📦 What’s Next?

You can now:
	•	Preview and edit the generated data
	•	Fine-tune a model on it (see our LoRA Fine-Tuning Guide)


# 💡 Pro Tips
	•	Upload diverse content to get a wide range of QA pairs.
	•	Use domain-specific instructions to control the output style.
	•	Start small (5–10 files) to experiment, then scale up.
