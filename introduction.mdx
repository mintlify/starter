## Why Prem?

**Prem** is a platform that's packaged with the necessary tools to effortlessly integrate Generative AI into your applications.

## With Prem you can:

- **Simultaneously test and monitor LLMs in the [_Prem Lab_](/get-started/lab):** Compare the performance of multiple models and find the best fit for your use case.
- **Train models in the [_Prem Gym_](/get-started/gym):** Leverage Prem’s ability to autonomously fine-tune models. The Gym is your place to beef up your deployment models by continuously fine-tuning your data in order to improve performance.
- **Seamlessly create [_RAG-based assistants_](/get-started/repositories):** Prem is capable of interacting with your documents. Just upload the documents, and we’ll take care of the rest.
- **[_Launch_](/get-started/launchpad) and use the [_Prem JavaScript and Python SDKs_](/get-started/sdk):** Integrate your custom AI into your applications with minimal effort.

</Step>

<Step title="Now it's time to integrate Prem into your application.">
## Choose an SDK and install
<Tip>
  Prem also exposes a simple [REST API](/api-reference/introduction) for interacting with the platform. 
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install premai
```

```bash JavaScript
npm install @premai/prem-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run your first project.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from premai import Prem

client = Prem(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY)

project_id = PROJECT_ID

system_prompt = "You're a helpful assistant"

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    messages=messages,
)

print(response.choices)

```

```javaScript JavaScript
import Prem from "@premai/prem-sdk";

const client = new Prem({
  apiKey: API_KEY,
});

const project_id = PROJECT_ID;

const system_prompt = "You're a helpful assistant";
const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Who won the World Series in 2020?" },
];

async function chatCompletion() {
  const responseSync = await client.chat.completions.create({
    project_id,
    system_prompt,
    messages,
  });

  console.log(responseSync);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

</Steps>



## Next steps

- Continue to test LLMs in the [Lab](/get-started/lab).
- Check out the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction).
- [Connect your documents](/get-started/repositories) to the LLM to enhance its knowledge.
- Fine-tune your LLMs in the [Gym](/get-started/gym).
