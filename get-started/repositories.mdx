**Repositories** are **Prem's** way of utlizing easy to use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with a model of your choice.
 
 **RAG** gives your models the ability to interact with your documents, gain knowledge and use it to generate responses based on the content of your documents. 
 
 This guide will show you how to create **RAG-based** assistant without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure like integrating a vector database or setting up a retrieval pipeline. Prem will take care of the heavy lifting for you. 
 
 Just worry about providing your documents and focus on the fun part, building your custom models.

<Tip>

**RAG** is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems and generative models to enable assistants to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the content of your documents.

</Tip>



## Before you get started

- Create a collection of documents that you'd like your LLM to interact with.

- Get a basic understanding of **Prem's** APIs and SDKs.

## Getting started: a step by step guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create A Repository and Upload Your Documents">
  <Tip>
    The max file size is: 10MB
  </Tip>
    - Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Repositories** page. Click **_New Repository_** to create a new place to store your documents.

  alt="Overview"
/>
    - Prepare your documents in a format supported by **Prem**, such as **PDF**, **TXT**, or **DOCX**. Ensure that the documents are clean, well-structured, and free of any formatting issues.

    - Upload your documents to a repository using **Prem's** interface, [API](/api-reference/introduction) or using [PremSDK](/get-started/sdk#repositories). You can either upload documents individually or in batches. Make sure to provide meaningful names or identifiers for your documents.

    - Once the documents are uploaded, **Prem** will automatically index them to enable fast and efficient retrieval. 
  <Warning>
  The indexing process may take some time depending on the size and number of documents.  
  </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Model and Configure Retrieval Settings">
  Once you've uploaded your documents, you need to configure the retrieval settings. Head over to the [Lab](/get-started/lab) and choose a suitable model to test with your documents.
  
   You can find the following retrieval settings in the **Lab** or in the **Launchpad**:

  - **Limit:** Sets the maximum number of top-matching documents to retrieve based on similarity.
  
  - **Similarity:** Measures how closely a query matches document embeddings. Higher values indicate greater similarity, ranging from 0 to 1.
  
  </Step>

  <Step title ="Fine-tune the model with the Gym">

  <Warning>
    You **MUST** add a project description, otherwise you will not be able to start the training.
  </Warning>

  - Fine-tune your selected model in the [Gym](/get-started/autonomous-fine-tuning) on your specific domain or task. This involves training the model on a subset of your documents and optimizing its parameters for better performance and coherence.
  - Integrate the fine-tuned model into your pipeline. When a user sends a query, the model will retrieve relevant documents from the repository and then pass them to the generative model to generate a contextually appropriate response.

  </Step>
  <Step title = "Testing and Evaluation">
Before deploying your configured model, it's crucial to thoroughly test and evaluate its performance in the **Lab**.

 - **Test Queries:** Prepare a set of test queries that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Send these queries to your assistant and evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated responses.

 - **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the evaluation results, iteratively refine your assistant by adjusting the retrieval settings, fine-tuning the generative model, or improving the document collection.
  
  <Note>You can see which documents were used as a verified source at the bottom of the model's response.</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title = "Deployment and Integration">
  Once you're satisfied with the performance of your models, you can deploy them with the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad) and integrate your application with the Prem [SDKs](/get-started/sdk) or [API](/api-reference/introduction).
