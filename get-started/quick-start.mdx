description: Let's get you started with Prem in minutes. In this guide, we'll show you how to use the **Chat Completions** functionality.
---
<Note>
This is a quickstart guide for using the **Chat Completions** functionality.

Chat completions allow you to choose a model (e.g. `llama3.2-3b` or the name of a model you fine-tuned) to generate a response using a text-based prompt.

Keep in mind that Prem is designed to make the process of creating custom models easy and efficient. Most of the functionality like fine-tuning, evaluations, stats and playground will be available on the Prem platform. Once you've configured your settings, you'll be able to use your custom models by simply using the [Prem AI API](/api-reference/introduction) or OpenAI SDKs.

If you want to learn about [Datasets](/datasets/overview), [Autonomous Fine-Tuning](/finetuning/overview), [Evaluations](/evaluations/overview), [Stats](/stats/overview) and [Playground](/playground/overview), please refer to those guides.
</Note>

The quickest way to get started with Prem is to use either the PremAI SDK or OpenAI SDKs for chat completions as shown below.

<Note>
You can also use the [Prem AI API](/api-reference/introduction) to generate chat completions.

With the API you can use any programming language that has an HTTP client.

We give you the option to use the [Prem AI API](/api-reference/introduction), the PremAI SDK, or the OpenAI SDKs.

For API usage documentation, refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).

## Install the PremAI SDK
<CodeGroup>
```bash javascript/typescript
npm install premai
```
```bash python
pip install premai
```
</CodeGroup>

## Chat Completions
import PremChatCompletions from '/snippets/prem-chat-completions.mdx';

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Client SDKs](/get-started/sdks) to learn how to use the PremAI SDK and OpenAI SDK.
- Add your own [Dataset](/datasets/overview) as a first step to create your own custom models.
- Next, [Autonomously Fine-Tune](/finetuning/overview) your models using a dataset.
- Then, use [Evaluations](/evaluations/overview) to track your model's performance.
- Afterwards, keep up with your model's performance with [Stats](/stats/overview).
- Finally, test your fine-tuned models and pre-trained models in the [Playground](/playground/overview).
- Bring your models to production or repeat any steps you need to improve your models or make new ones.
