This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a TRUF.NETWORK (TN) node. By following these steps, you'll be able to deploy a node, optionally become a validator, and contribute to the TN.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Kwild**: The all-in-one binary for node operation and administration.
- Download from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/trufnetwork/node/releases)

2. **Docker**: Required for running the PostgreSQL image.
- Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

3. **PostgreSQL Client**: Required for state sync and database operations.
- Install with `sudo apt -y install postgresql-16` (Ubuntu/Debian)

## Getting Started

### Get Kwild Binary

You have two options to get the `kwild` binary:

1. **Download from Releases**:
   - Visit [TRUF.NETWORK Node Releases](https://github.com/trufnetwork/node/releases)
   - Download the latest release for your operating system
   - Extract the binary and move it to your system path:
   ```bash
   sudo mv .build/kwild /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **Build from Source**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trufnetwork/node.git
   cd node
   task build
   ```
   The built binary will be in the `.build` directory. Move it to your system path:
   ```bash
   sudo mv .build/kwild /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the TRUF.NETWORK node operator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-operator.git
cd truf-node-operator
```

### 2. Generate Initial Configuration

Use `kwild` to create your initial configuration file:

```bash
kwild setup init \
  --genesis ./configs/network/v2/genesis.json \
  --root ./my-node-config \
  --p2p.bootnodes "4e0b5c952be7f26698dc1898ff3696ac30e990f25891aeaf88b0285eab4663e1#ed25519@node-1.mainnet.truf.network:26656,0c830b69790eaa09315826403c2008edc65b5c7132be9d4b7b4da825c2a166ae#ed25519@node-2.mainnet.truf.network:26656"
```

For detailed instructions on configuration options more relevant to a production setup, refer to our [Node Operator Repository](https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node-operator).

### 3. Enable State Sync

Edit the `config.toml` file in your node configuration directory to enable state sync:

```bash
# Edit the config.toml file
sed -i '/\[state_sync\]/,/^\[/ s/enable = false/enable = true/' ./my-node-config/config.toml
sed -i 's/trusted_providers = \[\]/trusted_providers = ["0c830b69790eaa09315826403c2008edc65b5c7132be9d4b7b4da825c2a166ae#ed25519@node-2.mainnet.truf.network:26656"]/' ./my-node-config/config.toml
```

This will configure your node to use state sync for faster synchronization with the network.

### 4. Set Up PostgreSQL

For a quick setup, run Kwil's pre-configured PostgreSQL Docker image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name tn-postgres \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    -v tn-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --shm-size=1gb \
    kwildb/postgres:latest
```
The command above:
- `-v tn-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: Creates a persistent volume named 'tn-pgdata' to store database data
- `--shm-size=1gb`: Allocates 1GB of shared memory for PostgreSQL operations (recommended for better performance)

#### Installing pg_dump for Snapshots

To enable state sync functionality, you'll need `pg_dump` installed. Here's how to install it:

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-16
```

For CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum install postgresql16
```

For macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install postgresql@16
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
pg_dump --version
```

This should show PostgreSQL version 16.x.x. The `pg_dump` utility is required for creating and restoring database snapshots during state sync.

If you prefer a custom PostgreSQL setup, ensure it meets the requirements specified in the [Kwil documentation](https://docs.kwil.com/docs/daemon/running-postgres).

**Security Warning**: It is recommended to not expose port 5432 publicly in production environments.

### 5. Deploy TN Node

Run the kwild binary to deploy your node:

```bash
kwild start -r ./my-node-config
```

You can run kwild in the background by adding `&` at the end of the command:

```bash
kwild start -r ./my-node-config &
```

This allows you to run other kwild commands in the same terminal session, such as checking node status or managing validators.

Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections on:
- JSON-RPC port (default: 8484)
- P2P port (default: 6600)

### 6. Verify Node Synchronization

Before proceeding to become a validator, ensure your node is fully synced with the network:

```bash
kwild admin status
```

Look for `syncing: false` in the output, and check that your `best_block_height` is close to the current network height.

### 7. Become a Validator (Optional)

To upgrade your node to a validator:

1. Ensure your node is fully synced with the network.
2. Submit a validator join request:

```bash
kwild validators join
```

3. Wait for approval from existing validators. You can check your join request status with:

```bash
kwild validators list-join-requests
```

Existing validators must approve your request. For each existing validator needed to approve:

```bash
kwild validators approve <your-node-id>
```

The node ID format for validator operations is: `<public key>#<key type>`. For example:
```bash
kwild validators approve 03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1
```

You can find your node's public key and key type by running:
```bash
kwild key info --key-file ./my-node-config/nodekey.json
```

Note: If you used a different directory name during setup (not `./my-node-config`), replace the path with your actual node configuration directory path.

You can always reach out to the community for help with the validator process.

### 8. Submit Your Node to Available Node List (Optional)

To help others discover your node:

1. Fork the TN repository.
2. Add your node information to the `configs/network/available_nodes.json` file.
3. Submit a Pull Request with your changes.

We'll review and merge your PR to include your node in the network's seed list.

## Network Configuration Files

Essential network configuration files are located in the `configs/network/` directory:

- `v2/genesis.json`: The network's genesis file.
- `v2/network-nodes.csv`: List of available nodes for peer discovery.

When setting up your node, refer to these files for network-specific parameters and peer information.

## Node ID Format

Node IDs in TRUF.NETWORK follow the format: `<public key>#<key type>@<IP address>:<port>`

You can find your node ID by running:
```bash
kwild key info --key-file ./my-node-config/nodekey.json
```
