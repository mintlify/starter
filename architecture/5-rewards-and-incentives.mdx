Sage implements a transparent incentive architecture designed to reward authentic social contributions and meaningful user engagement. At the core of this incentive system is the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/core-concepts/posc) mechanism, closely integrated with Sage’s native [**Earned Mint Token (EMT)**](/introduction/3-emt), the [**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust) token.

### **Reward Calculation & Distribution**

Rewards in Sage are calculated based on clearly defined metrics tied directly to verified user actions:

- **Action-Based Rewards**: Each eligible action—such as creating content, engaging through likes or comments, or joining channels—is explicitly assigned a numeric weight (`RewardWeight`) reflecting its baseline contribution value to the Sage ecosystem.
- **RewardWeights Registry**: Action weights are managed transparently through the `RewardWeights` structure, specifying clear start and end epochs. The `RewardWeightsRegistry` maintains a historical record of these weights, providing complete auditability of reward configurations over time.
- **Transaction Fee Alignment**: Reward calculations explicitly utilize transaction fees generated by user actions, ensuring incentives accurately reflect genuine onchain economic contributions.

### **Earned Mint Token (EMT) – \$TRUST**

The \$TRUST token operates under Sage’s Earned Mint Token (EMT) model:

- **Minting Logic**: \$TRUST tokens are minted exclusively from verified user actions. Users claim and mint tokens based directly on Sage’s reward calculations, secured by explicit validation through the `RewardWitness` mechanism.
- **Controlled Supply**: Token minting is precisely regulated via the protocol’s `MintConfig`, explicitly defining parameters like minting enablement and maximum token supply. This approach ensures a sustainable token economy aligned explicitly with authentic user engagement and network growth.

### **Incremental Rewards**

To promote sustained user participation, Sage employs an incremental rewards model:

- **Initial user contributions** (e.g., creating posts) explicitly receive immediate, clearly defined rewards managed by the `Reward Registry` module.
- **Subsequent content interactions** (e.g., likes, comments, and shares) generate additional incremental rewards tracked through Sage’s analytics system and calculated and distributed through the `Reward Actions` module. These incremental incentives continuously reward both content creators and active participants, fostering ongoing engagement and meaningful interactions.

### **Reward Witness Authorization**

Security and transparency are reinforced through explicit reward claim validation via the `RewardWitnessConfig`. This configuration clearly defines authorized witness types required at runtime, ensuring only validated, authenticated actions result in token minting.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s reward architecture provides significant practical benefits:

- **Transparency and Auditability**: Clearly defined reward weights and comprehensive historical analytics data are transparently recorded onchain. This ensures all reward issuance remains fully auditable and easily verifiable over time.
- **Sustainable Economic Design**: Directly aligning rewards with actual transaction fees and carefully controlling token minting parameters ensures long-term economic sustainability. This model allows the token economy to naturally scale in proportion to genuine user activity.
- **Flexible and Upgradeable**: Administrators can securely adjust reward configurations (such as `RewardWeights` and `MintConfig`) dynamically at runtime without redeploying smart contracts. This ensures Sage can efficiently adapt to evolving community needs and ecosystem conditions.
- **Genuine Engagement Incentives**: The incremental rewards approach explicitly encourages high-quality user interactions, rewarding sustained community engagement and ensuring continuous, authentic participation across the Sage ecosystem.
