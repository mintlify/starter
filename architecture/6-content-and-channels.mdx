Sage Protocol manages user-generated content and community interactions using decentralized, blockchain-native structures. This design integrates content handling, moderation, economic incentives, and transaction fees directly into the blockchain architecture.

### **Content Management**

User-generated content in Sage is managed through verifiable blockchain structures:

- **Posts: **Managed via the `Post` structure, each post explicitly stores metadata (title, description), content data, author details, timestamps, interaction metrics (likes, comments), and edit/delete status.
- **Engagement Interactions: **Explicit actions such as likes and comments are transparently tracked within dedicated onchain substructures (`Likes` and `Posts`). These interactions increment engagement metrics used directly for reward calculations and analytics.
- **Fee Management: **The `PostFees` structure explicitly defines configurable transaction fees required for creating or interacting with content. Fees can be denominated in native \$SUI tokens or custom token denominations, directly aligning economic incentives with authentic user activity.

### **Channels & Community Management**

Channels within Sage offer decentralized, structured environments for building and managing communities directly onchain:

- **Channels: **Defined by the `Channel` structure, each channel transparently manages metadata (avatar, banner, description), moderation roles, membership details, and interaction histories. All channel activities, including moderation updates and membership management, are recorded explicitly onchain.
- **Membership & Moderation: **Membership states, join/leave timestamps, and user interactions are explicitly managed through the `Membership` structure. Moderation roles and permissions are clearly defined within the `Moderation` structure, providing secure and transparent onchain community governance.
- **Channel Fees: **Transaction fees associated with channel creation, membership changes, posting, and moderation activities are managed explicitly via the `ChannelFees` structure. These fees help maintain economically sustainable community operations.

### **Cross-Application Interoperability**

Sage supports interoperability through structured indexing mechanisms:

- **App and Channel Registries: **Structures like `AppChannelRegistry` and `ChannelRegistry` explicitly map channels to their originating applications, facilitating easy portability and interoperability of communities across all Sage-compatible applications.
- **Content Indexing: **The `PostsKey` structure explicitly links content to specific applications, enabling consistent indexing and cross-application content reuse.

### **Security via Witness Validation**

Sensitive operations within channels are secured explicitly using runtime witness-based validation:

- **ChannelWitness: **Channel-related administrative operations (such as moderation updates) explicitly require runtime validation via the `ChannelWitness` capability, ensuring secure, verifiable, and authorized modifications.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s explicit decentralized approach delivers significant practical benefits:

- **Transparent Content & Engagement: **Every action—content creation, user interactions, moderation—is transparently recorded onchain, fostering accountability, trust, and verifiability.
- **Portable & Resilient Communities: **Decentralized channel structures resist censorship and enable seamless portability across applications, supporting open and resilient social communities.
- **Economically Aligned Participation: **Explicit transaction fee structures and clearly integrated rewards ensure incentives directly align with genuine community engagement and authentic content creation, promoting sustainable ecosystem growth.
- **Secure & Modular Governance: **Clearly defined moderation roles and explicit witness-based access controls provide secure, transparent, and adaptable management of community dynamics, enhancing overall security and operational flexibility.
