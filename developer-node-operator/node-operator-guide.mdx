This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Truflation Stream Network (TSN) node. By following these steps, you'll be able to deploy a node, optionally become a validator, and contribute to the TSN.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Kwil-admin**: Used to generate the initial configuration file.

- Download from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases)

2. **Docker**: Required for running the PostgreSQL image.

- Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

3. **TSN Binaries**: Necessary for node deployment.

- Download from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/trufnetwork/truf-node/releases)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Generate Initial Configuration

Use `kwil-admin` to create your initial configuration file. For example:

```bash
kwil-admin setup peer  \
-g ./configs/network/staging/genesis.json \
--root-dir ./my-peer-config/ \
--chain.p2p.persistent-peers c6d2ea1e573d207cc31b7e17c771ab8ca2091b22@staging.node-1.tsn.truflation.com:26656,34599966ce4b67628f4cfa99fdca74ea2d039018@staging.node-2.tsn.truflation.com:26656
```

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL

For a quick setup, run Kwil's pre-configured PostgreSQL Docker image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name tsn-postgres \
 -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
 -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
 kwildb/postgres:latest
```

If you prefer a custom PostgreSQL setup, ensure it meets the requirements specified in the [configuration guide](https://docs.kwil.com/docs/daemon/running-postgres).

### 3. Deploy TSN Node

#### 3.1. Install PSQL

To be able to Snapshot from the network, you need to have `psql` installed on your machine. You can install it by running:

```bash
sudo apt -y install postgresql
```

#### 3.2. Run TSN Binaries

Run the TSN binaries to deploy your node:

```bash
kwild --root-dir ./my-peer-config/ --chain.statesync.enable=true --chain.statesync.rpc-servers='http://18.189.163.27:26657'
```

Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections on the JSON-RPC port (default: 8484) and P2P port (default: 26656).

The `--chain.statesync.enable` and `--chain.statesync.rpc-servers` flags are optional and only needed if you want to enable state sync on your node. It will help your node to sync faster with the network with the snapshot provided by the RPC servers.

### 4. Become a Validator (Optional)

To upgrade your node to a validator:

1. Ensure your node is fully synced with the network.
2. Submit a validator join request:

```bash
kwil-admin validators join --rpcserver /path/to/your/node.sock
```

3. Wait for approval from existing validators. You can check your join request status with:

```bash
kwil-admin validators join-status <your-public-key> --rpcserver /path/to/your/node.sock
```

You can always ping us for help in the validator process.

### 5. Submit Your Node to Available Node List (Optional)

To help others discover your node:

1. Fork the TSN repository.
2. Add your node information to the `configs/network/available_nodes.json` file.
3. Submit a Pull Request with your changes.

We'll review and merge your PR to include your node in the network's seed list.

## Network Configuration Files

Essential network configuration files are located in the `configs/network/` directory:

- `genesis.json`: The network's genesis file.
- `network-nodes.csv`: List of available nodes for peer discovery.

When setting up your node, refer to these files for network-specific parameters and peer information.
