## Enterprise OnPrem Solution

For organizations that require the data to never leave their own infrastructure, we offer a managed on-premise service.

By providing our team temporary access to an isolated area of your infrastructure, we can install LangWatch on your premises to get you up and running in no time.

## Local Testing Environment

For testing purposes, we provide a docker-compose setup for a local testing environment that can be installed on your local machine. This allows you to test LangWatch for sensitive data without having to install it on your production environment.

**Note:** This setup is not scalable for production workloads. For production deployments, please consider our [Cloud](https://app.langwatch.ai) or [Enterprise On-Premises solution](#enterprise-on-premises-solution).

### Setup

At this moment, we are looking for feedback from our users on the docker-compose setup and understanding your use case.
